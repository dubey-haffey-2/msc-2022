<h2>Title of Project:  Nature of co-occurring worry in autism.</h2>

<h3>Name of Lead Investigator:  Dr Indu Dubey (De Montfort University) </h3>

<h4>Invitation paragraph</h4>
You have been invited to take part in a research study.  Before you decide whether to take part it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.  Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with friends and relatives if you wish to. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether you wish to take part or not.  Thank you for reading this.<br><br>

<h4>What is the study about?</h4>
Worry is a commonly reported difficulty in several mental health conditions. A large number of people who are diagnosed with autism also report having significant worry interfering with their day to day life. In this study we aim to explore various ways through which different events or situations may affect the experience of worry in adults with and without autism or other mental health conditions.<br><br>

<h4>What does the study involve?</h4>
If you decide to participate you will be asked to follow links to the different parts of online study. The study has been divided into three parts and each part has its separate link. You can choose to complete either one, two or all three parts. Each link has two questionnaires and one choice game in them. These questionnaires would have items related to your day to day preferences and behaviours. You would be expected to give a response to all the items presented. You will also play a “Choose a movie” game. In this game you will see two boxes on the screen with different numbers of locks on them. You will be asked to choose any one of the boxes to look at the linked images or videos. To open any box, you would need to press the keys as many times as the locks on the chosen box. There is no right or wrong way of choosing the boxes and there is no score for choosing any one box. You will be free to choose any box and look at the images/videos you like. At the end, you will be directed to the completion page. A debrief form will be sent to you via email at the end of your participation in the study. The debrief form will tell you a little more about the study and would provide you the information about the researcher if you would like to know more about the project. <br><br>

<h4>Why have I been chosen?</h4>
Any adult above 18 years of age can participate in the study. We are interested in understanding the nature of worry in adults. Since most people experience some of other form of worry at some point in their lives, the study would benefit from the participation of adults from wide range of experiences. As the nature of the project, we would be particularly interested in involving adults who have received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or anxiety disorders (irrespective of co-occurring conditions). <br><br>

<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.  If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a consent form.  If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time during the data collection without giving a reason.<br><br>

<h4>I am interested in taking part, what do I do next?</h4>
Please contact the researcher who’s contact details are shared in the advertisement. The researcher will then send you an email with your unique participation code and links to the online study. Please find a quiet room with minimal distractions. Please ensure you have a good internet connection on a PC / laptop / tablet device. Please do not run the study on a mobile phone. Every person completes the tasks with different speed however we expect that it may take you between 35 – 45 minutes to complete each link. Make sure that you have sufficient time to complete each part of the study. Once ready please follow the link to the online study.<br><br>

<h4>What if I agree to take part and then change my mind?</h4>
If you would like to withdraw from the study before completing the tasks, you will be able to do this by closing the browser. Since we would not know if the task was skipped due to technical error or you wished to withdraw, you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. Researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID. You can withdraw from the study at any stage including after the completing the study, without giving a reason. If you decide to withdraw you would need to provide your participation ID to the researchers. The researcher will then delete all the data generated by that ID from their computers. Please note that you can withdraw from the study only up to two days after the completion of the study. <br><br>

<h4>What is the procedure that is being tested?</h4>
You will be asked to participate in the study using your private computer/laptop/tablet device but NOT mobile phones. <br><br>

<h4>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h4>
Participation in this study can be tiring as each part may take approximately 35-45 minutes to respond to various questions and game on computer. Therefore, it is suggested that you take part only when you are feeling ready to spend required time on the tasks. Also, for some people making choices, looking at randomly chosen video clips of natural scenes, smiling people, or any ambiguity can be difficult to deal with. If you think you may feel distressed by these then we advise you not to participate in the study. <br><br>

<h4>What are the possible benefits of taking part? </h4>
There is no direct benefit to the participants however your participation will help us understanding the nature of worry in autism. This can then help in developing suitable interventions for the same. <br><br>
